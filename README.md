# TODO-LIST-task-2-

About This Code:

A simple console to-do app that lets users add, view, and remove tasks from a list, with automatic file saving.

What I Learn:

File Handling : (Save/load tasks using open() and file read/write operations)

Lists : (Store and manipulate tasks with append() and pop() methods)

String Manipulation : (Clean input with .strip() and format output for display)
